# Project Overview

This project involves converting a static HTML website into a CMS-ready Next.js site using mocked API data. You will be working with a folder called `theme` that contains the HTML structure and using mock data from `pages/api/mock-api.json`. The goal is to dynamically generate pages using this CMS mock data, ensuring the site is ready for integration with a real CMS.

## Key Directories

- **theme/**: Contains the static HTML files you will convert to reusable Next.js components.
- **public/**: Holds all static assets (images, icons, etc.) to be referenced within the app.
- **pages/api/mock-api.json**: Contains mock CMS data, which will simulate the CMS behavior during development.
- **pages/[...permalink].js**: This file dynamically generates pages based on the `permalink` field in the mock API.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Install dependencies**:
   Run the following command to install necessary dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Folder Structure**:
   - `theme/`: Use the HTML files from the `theme` folder as a reference and convert them into Next.js components.
   - `pages/api/mock-api.json`: This file contains mock data resembling a real CMS. You will use this data to dynamically generate pages and render components.

3. **Rendering Pages**:
   - **[...permalink].js** is responsible for dynamically generating pages based on the `permalink` field from the CMS mock data.
   - Each page consists of multiple blocks, and these blocks are mapped to specific components based on the `name` field.

4. **Add New Components**:
   - Create new components for each section of the HTML structure in `theme/`.
   - Import the new components in `Render.js` and map the block `name` from the mock API to the component.
   - Example of adding a new component:
     ```js
     import NewComponent from './components/NewComponent';

     case 'NewComponent':
       return <NewComponent data={data} />;
     ```

5. **getStaticPaths**:
   Generates static pages during build time based on the `permalink` field from the mock API.

6. **getStaticProps**:
   Fetches the appropriate page data for each `permalink` and passes it as props to render the dynamic page content.

## Working with Head Component

- **Migrating Head Elements**:
   - Move all `<title>`, `<meta>`, and other head elements from the HTML into the `<Head>` component.
   - For example, if the theme has:
     ```html
     <head>
       <title>My Page</title>
       <meta name="description" content="Sample description">
       <link rel="icon" href="/favicon.ico">
     </head>
     ```
     Convert it to:
     ```jsx
     <Head>
       <title>{title}</title> {/* Use dynamic title from mock API */}
       <meta name="description" content="Sample description" />
       <link rel="icon" href="/favicon.ico" />
     </Head>
     ```

- **Dynamic Meta Tags**:
   - If the CMS mock data contains dynamic meta tags (like `global_tags`), render them inside the `<Head>` component.
   ```jsx
   <Head>
     <title>{title}</title>
     {global_tags.map(tag => (
       <meta key={tag.attributes.key} name={tag.attributes.key} content={tag.attributes.content} />
     ))}
   </Head>
   ```

## Public Directory for Static Assets

- **Moving Static Files**:
   - All static assets like images, fonts, and icons should be placed in the `public/` directory.
   - Update image references in your components to point to the public directory. For example:
     ```html
     <img src="/assets/logo.png" alt="Logo">
     ```

- **Favicon**:
   - Move favicon files into `public/` and update the `<Head>` component to use the correct path:
     ```jsx
     <Head>
       <link rel="icon" href="/favicon.ico" />
     </Head>
     ```

## Handling Images with Defaults

When rendering images from the mock API, always provide a fallback image if the image URL is not available. You can store a default image in the `public/` folder and reference it whenever necessary.

### Example of Image Fallback

```jsx
import React from 'react';

function ExampleComponent({ data }) {
  const defaultImage = '/assets/default-image.png'; // Path to the default image in public/

  return (
    <div>
      <img src={data.image?.value || defaultImage} alt={data.image?.alt || 'Default Image'} />
    </div>
  );
}

export default ExampleComponent;
```

In this example, if the `data.image.value` is null or undefined, it falls back to `defaultImage`, ensuring that the site always displays a valid image.

## Notes for Development

- **API Data Comments**: Whenever you encounter something that might be off in the API data or a component, please add a comment starting with `note:`. This will help identify potential issues or inconsistencies.
- **Handling Visuals**: Try to keep consistency with the photos provided in each file. Tailwind is available for minor modifications to the styling.

## Checklist for Migration

- **Head Elements**: Migrate titles, meta tags, and favicons into the `<Head>` component.
- **Static Assets**: Move all images, fonts, and other static assets into the `public/` directory.
- **Image Fallbacks**: Ensure all images use a default if the CMS data doesn't provide an image.
- **Components**: Create reusable components based on the HTML structure in the `theme` folder and map them to blocks in the mock API.
- **Dynamic Pages**: Ensure pages are dynamically generated based on the mock CMS data using `getStaticPaths` and `getStaticProps`.

## Conclusion

By following this guide, youâ€™ll convert the static HTML theme into a fully dynamic Next.js website ready to be connected to a CMS. Make sure to use the mock data effectively and add fallback mechanisms (like default images) to handle missing data gracefully.
